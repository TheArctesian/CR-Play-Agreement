# Common Room Play Agreement 

## Overview 
The current rules set by the SSC (Senior Student Commie), 
```
the fee for any ball games is $20 
```
No mention of currency. 

I felt that this ruling was quite lazy from the democratically elected commie, and feel as if the agreement needs to change. The initial ruling was set to mitigate damages of property in the common room, due to previous incidents involving one Nicholas. Though the actions done by the individual, and the lack of responsibility showed from his actions, require displanary action, the actions taken by the incompetent authority untimely lead loss in potential mental health benfits, as stated in these studies. [The Exercise Effect, 2011](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/12/exercise), [How Sports Affects Your Mental Health](https://lifeworkscc.com/sports-affects-mental-health/). I propose that the rule be changed and replaced with a contract. The contract can be found here. 

The TLDR is: 
- Your agree that you are responsible for any harm to protpery or health 
- You will pay reparations for the harm, with an additional 10% of total cost being given to the SSC
- Playing games without the signing of this contract will lead to disciplinary action from school as well as a fine of, $20 Hong Kong Dollar.

To agree you will submit a video of you saying the words
```
I agree to uphold the clauses stated in the contract <something> 
```
to the website (link). 

This will be subject to democratic vote on the school discord server.
